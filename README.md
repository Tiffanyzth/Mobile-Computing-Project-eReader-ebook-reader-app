**Introduction** 

eReader is a TXT file reader running on Android. Users can open the TXT file to read through the software.
The main interface is a bookshelf style ListView. Users can see the most recently opened files on the bookshelf. The last file to be used is the first in the list. There is a Settings button on the main interface. Before entering the reading stage, users can change the font size, font color, background picture, page-turning mode and other Settings. Page-turning mode provides two kinds of effects: slide mode and paper mode. The effect of the paper mode looks like a real paper page turning.
There is a Folder button next to the Settings button in the main interface menu bar. This button can open the local file browser. Users can enter the directory they want to look up, then select TXT file to open.
In the reading interface, the user can swipe left or right to realize the page turning. At the first and last page, there will be “no further forward or backward flip” reminder.
